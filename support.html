                            <p>Payment is due and payable immediately upon completion of the purchase process. Performance starts immediately after a successful transaction by unlocking Premium features in Spendee. It proceeds by electronic means and is not subject to any extra fees.</p>
                            
                            <p>If you purchased a subscription, it will automatically renew itself for another term of the same length, unless you cancel it before the current term runs out. The subscription price is charged on the first day of the new term. You can cancel your subscription at any time. The cancellation will take effect the day after the last day of the current subscription term and Spendee will be downgraded.</p>
                            
                            <p>Distribution platforms accept various payment methods, including but not limited to, credit and debit cards, gift cards or PayPal.</p>
                            
                            <p>Provider itself doesn't store any payment information or process payments. Distribution platforms or their contractors are solely responsible for the payment processing.</p>
                            
                            <p>Refunds for the in-app purchases are generally not provided.</p>
                            
                            <h2>Trials</h2>
                            
                            <p>Provider may offer subscriptions with a specified trial period without payment. However, you are required to provide your payment details to start such subscription. The regular subscription plan with your selected term will begin automatically after the expiry of the trial period, unless you cancel it before the period runs out. The first payment for the subscription will process on the first day following the end of the trial period. By starting the subscription with trial period and providing your payment details you agree with possible future charges for the subscription.</p>
